Version 8.2.9<br>

<br>
<b>I. GENERAL BULLSHIT</b><br>
<p>The Restoration Project is a mod for Baldur's Gate aiming to restore literally all unused sounds, as well as some minor cut characters or locations. In recent iterations it evolved into the younger, brasher sidekick of Unfinished Business.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>II. WHAT THE MOD DOES</b><br>
<br>
<b>A. Restored Locations</b>
<p>This component adds, restores content to or tweaks some locations that didn't make it to the released version or had any missing content.
<ul>
<li> A tent in Trademeet<br>
<img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RxP0c-ZdkSE/T2W8Sw2IQcI/AAAAAAAAAAM/AML0CiYmdvE/s1600/AR2000.png">
<li> A bedroom in Kiser Jhaeri's house, in Saradush, accessible by clicking the wall on the right.
<li> You can now open the front door to Yaga-Shura's crib, if you're strong enough.
<li> Some cloaks in Aran Linvail's cloakroom. (Those are jokes and remnants of the mod's very first release called Realistic Cloakroom.)
<li> The Summoning Book in the second level of Spellhold gets an extra page, just like planned. It's an adamantine golem.
<li> The Sahuagin trap in the Planar Sphere now functions like intended, locking you in the room for the duration of the fight.
<li> You now get hints on the 4th level of Watcher's Keep. Look for new regions on the floor. I know it stumbled me when I was playing the first time.
<li> When you get to the Spellhold with Desharik's help, you are greeted with a new text screen with original narration! The picture isn't quite right, but I'm not graphic artist and that one was set as default.
<li> In the extremely unlikely event of giving Nizdramanii'yt everything you've got for the goblet of life, you are treated with a description of his leave.
</ul>
<b>B. Restored Characters and dialogues</b>
<p>This component restores a few cut characters. Most of them don't have any real role, but serve as flavor.
<ul>
<li> A drow cook in the Ust'Natha tavern.
<li> Becky and Diane, a family living in the tent added by the previous component (synergy!).
<li> An Amnish privateer and his execution on Brynnlaw.
<li> An additional grieving nobleman on Nalia's father's funeral.
<li> A vampire in the Mind Flayers' dungeon in the Underdark.
<li> Two Cowled Enforcerers in the Council of Six building. One of them has something to say about Tolgerias's quest.
<li> More people now join the final Bodhi crypt crawl! Kalden and Levin Rayn come to help from the Order of the Most Radiant Heart. And from the Shadow Thieves, there's Natas and Alyra.
<li> Petr the dwarf is now encounterable during the Metrich Quest.
<li> In Suldanesselar, a rakshasa by the name of Ziyaad is waiting in the Rillifane Lockbox house. He's hostile.
<li> Two D'Aerthe guards now guard Jarlaxle's headquarters. You're probably not gonna interact much with them if you're not killing Jarlaxle, though.
<li> Two new demons to be met during the Planar Sphere quest. One is Mane, to be met when on an excursion for the demon heart, and the second sneaks inside the sphere during that.
<li> Falik now exists for more than cannon fodder. You can talk to him, and discover that wolfweres are pretty moronic.
<li> There's a new encounter in Windspear Hills, consisting of two hobgoblin bandits ganging up on some merchants. 
<li> Daleson comes back to the Fighter's Stronghold and gives out comments depending on how great/horrible you are.
<li> A Tax Collector can be found between the manors of Deril and Jysstevs.
<li> The infamous Gas Spores make an appearance in one of the beholder tunnels.
<li> Drenden Shale, a druid, appears in the Grove as a placeholder.
</ul>
Additionally, since version 5 the component also restores quite a few dialog options.
<ul>
<li> Deirex now talks to you after you come back to his house.
<li> You can tell off Pelanna in one more way. Can be screwy if the Pause All Dialogues component from BG2Tweaks is installed.
<li> General Sovalidaas can now Sovali-diss Viconia when you talk to him while controlling her.
<li> Sir Donalus gets new dialog options depending on your standing with the Order.
<li> You can now resign from doing the job for Alibakkars or Lurraxols and pick the other family.
<li> If you've heard of Valygar's cabin from getting his tax notice, you can ask Umar villagers about it.
<li> Viconia gets a brand new banter in which she asks you whether Irenicus is such a big deal if at all.
<li> Lea'liyl's previously unseen dialogue now fires off properly. He's a demon in the Abyss.
<li> Imoen now helps you locate the switch for the lightning machine. It's useful if you're playing for the first time, and don't know how to equip weapons, and then you die to the seemingly infinite mephits!
<li> Firkraag now taunts you when you enter his dungeon. He also does it when you escape upstairs from the fight. It's class-dependent, so he'll be even more of a dick towards paladins!
<li> Olma, you cook, has now an extra dialogue for non-main characters.
<li> Chatting with Volo now adds a journal entry.
<li> The laborer in the government district had his timed triggers simplified, and can now say an additional line.
<li> Anomen now bugs you about rescuing Garren's child in two manners, the newer of which only activates once.
<li> You can now ask Hendak about Imoen, if for some reason you don't know the plot to Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn.
<li> Fezhak can be resurrected using Mass Resurrection.
<li> Carras and the monk narcs now react with dialogue when attacked.
<li> You can now replaced the killed genie in Ust'Natha with a bought slave monster.
<li> Haer'Dalis will now leave after some time if you wander around with the gem in your pocket. This fails the quest, naturally.
<li> You can now attack the Fear demon in Hell to assert your goodness.
<li> Refusal to pay the 300 GP for Vithal's spellbook and the drow woodcutters reveal now add new journal entries.
<li> Town Crier Neckeith now has a new line when you dismiss his news about Gambiton.
<li> There are eight new default/multiplayer dialogues.
</ul>
<b>C. Restored Sounds</b>
<p> The biggest and the most important component, it restores proper damaged, dying and morale break sounds to over 1600 characters. A few of them also have additional unused sounds for other occasions.</br>
<br>
<b>D. Restored Items</b>
<p>This component restores some items not added by any other mods.
<ul>
<li> Blessed bolts (one each in every good-aligned god's temple) 
<li> Purple and red potions (in the tent added by the first component. yess)
<li> Horn of Kazgaroth (Deril has it)
<li> Boots of Phasing (In Viekang's possession, both in ToB and Soa)
<li> Boots of Lightning Speed (Habib has them. That's why throws the sword, btw)
<li> The illusion-covered paladins at Windspear Hills now carry a letter from Firkraag, designed to make you way more angry.
<li> Am-Si now keeps a key to the kidnapper's hideout, if for some reason you kill him without talking to him.
</ul>
<b>E. Restored Wish Options</b>
<p>This component restores two cut Wish options, them being:
<ul>
<li> Globe of Blades on caster (For casters with WIS > 18)
<li> Party gains 10,000 GP (For casters with WIS < 9)
</ul>
<b>F. Restored XP tables in ToB</b>
<p>This component restores XP rewards for doing minor things in ToB, for example:
<ul>
<li> Talking to the heads in the Forest of Tethyr
<li> Putting together the Big Metal Unit
<li> Also freeing Ehlastra gave an incorrect XP value.
</ul>
<b>G. Restored random encounters</b>
<p>This component restores random encounters both in SoA and ToB. 
<ul>
<li> A singular ogre that could attack you in the wilderness after all set encounters take place 
<li> A band of noble brigands that will attack you somewhere between Amkethran, Abazigal's Lair and Sendai's Enclave
<li> A party of evil bounty hunters after your head. Yeah you've seen some of those names before. Same place.
</ul>
<b>H. Deril Lich (Or, Cernd's quest getting some closure)</b>
<p>If you obtained Cernd's son peacefully, Deril will come back as a lich after three days, if Cernd is still in the party. After a short battle he'll run back to his house, where you can dispose of him permanently.<br>
<br>
<b>I. Minor restorations</b>
<p>This component now restored various data, mainly forgotten/replaced icons.<ul>
<li> Saradush gets a new icon after being sacked by Yaga-Shura.<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/L6yxb6Z.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" />
<li> Berserker's <i>Enrage</i>, Monk's <i>Lay On Hands</i> and Ranger's <i>Charm Animal</i> all have restored icons to make them distinct from other abilities with this name. Additionally, Avenger's <i>Shapeshifts Baby Wyvern</i> icon now has a baby wyvern on it.
<li> Ranger's Tracking now gets the more sensible, scrapped line when tracking with no monsters present.
<li> The troll in the Copper Coronet's gladiator cutscene is now a black bear, as indicated by his filename, death variable and items.
<li> Saemon Havarian now properly disguises you as a monk when you sneak into Amkethran. Complete with journal entries.
<li> You get additional descriptions of your win or loss during the final de'Arnise Keep battle.
<li> The Slayer form now grants a 100 HP bonus, as intended in the description, instead of setting it to 100.
</ul>
<b>J. Better Item Import</b>
<p>With this addition, the Plane of Air djinn, also known as Malaaq, will hand you one additional weapon. What it will be depends entirely on what you carried with you when you imported the game. It could be a Flame Tongue, Bali's Axe, Longtooth dagger, Kiel's morgenstern, Root of the Problem, or something else! Not needed in BG2EE following patch 1.3.<br> 
<br>
<b>K. Final Slayer Dream</b>
<p>Previous version of this mod kept the Slayer Test Area as a minor quest area with a dumbass requirement. It was pretty bad. With this component installed, the STA is finally a fully-fledged area, with a dream introduction and everything, just like Our Bioware In Heaven intended. Just sleep a few times after the dream in which Ellesime talks to you, and it will all be revealed.<br>
<br>
<b>L. Alternate Slayer change</b>
<p>Originally, the Slayer change was supposed to drain the party of their vital forces and cause horror in everyone witnessing it, until the player masters the Slayer in the Ancient Grove. This component restores this ability. It's optional, since some people could actually dislike this change.<br>
<br>
<b>M. Extended Waukeen's Promenade Cutscene</b>
<p>I have recently uncovered some unused lines voiced by Irenicus, Gaelan and Imoen, which were set to be used in a more coservative, dialog-based Waukeen's Promenade cutscene. In the change, they were lost. Despite being only six lines in total, they neatly explain why Gaelan knew where you were going and why does nobody care about the kidnapped thiefs. Also, some old-fashioned crazy mage yelling.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>III. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION</b><br>
<p>To install, extract the contents of arpvX.zip to your main BG2 directory (on Windows) or Baldur's Gate 2.app/drive_c/[further path] (WINE-compatible macs), then double-click the setup-arestorationp.exe file, or setup-arestorationp.command if your computer is a Mac and follow the instructions on screen. If you play bideo james on Linux you probably know what to do already.<br>
<p>To uninstall, do the same.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>IV. COMPATIBILITY</b><br>
<p>Quest Pack should preferably be installed after installing component G. Apart from that, ARP is fully compatible with every single mod, thanks to the magic of SmartCoding.<br>
<br>
